# BMI-Python-Tkinter
# 🧮 Beginner-BMI-Calculator-Python-tkinter
This is my *beginner project* using Python and Tkinter.  
It’s a simple *BMI (Body Mass Index)* calculator that takes your height and weight as input and tells you your BMI along with the health category (e.g., Underweight, Normal, Overweight, etc.).

I followed a YouTube tutorial to learn how to build this and understand the basics of creating interactive GUI apps in Python.


### 🔧 Features
- 🖥 Easy-to-use GUI  
- 📏 Calculates BMI from Height (cm) and Weight (kg)  
- ✅ Shows BMI result with category (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, etc.)  
- 👶 Fully beginner-friendly code


## 📚 Tutorial Credit
